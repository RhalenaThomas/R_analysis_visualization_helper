# R_analysis_visualization_helper
R helper functions and workbooks for visualizations and statistical analysis for molecular biology data


# Organization

- Functions are directly in an R file and not in a library, this is for easy customization of the functions for your partical needs.
- The required inputs and libaries are in the comments and the output is described.
- Example usage of the functions is shown in workbooks with descriptions for how to prepare the input.
- Most functions are flexible for different datatypes
- Pull/download the repository and you can call the functions using "source" or copy the functions directly into your code.  

# Type of functions

1. Differential Expression Analysis outputs
a) Volcano plots
b) Filtering for significance and getting Gene/Protein counts
c) Comparing contrasts and gene/protein overlap: bar charts, VENN diagrams, heatmaps
d) Visualization of genes/proteins of interest: heatmaps of expression grouping different variables, denograms, controling colours and axis order or hiearchical clustering.
